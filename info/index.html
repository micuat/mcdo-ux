<p>We received so many responses and are so excited about all of the ideas, projects, questions. For the 1st meetup, we want to make sure that everyone who wants to has a chance to share and to see what other people are working on. With that in mind we are organizing the meetup into three sections:</p>
<p>(following times are in UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>18:00 - 18:30: Introduction from Olivia + words from organizers</li>
<li>18:30 - 19:30: Show and tell! Say hi and share one thing you are interested in or working on. Please keep it to 2 minutes max so we have time to hear from everyone!</li>
<li>19:30 - 20:00: Breakout rooms to discuss specific topics and ask hydra questions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introductions">Introductions</h2>
<p>In order to keep everything quick, we created this page to share links and images ahead of time for the meetup. Please add whatever you would like to share by editing this spreadsheet (don’t edit the header, and be respectful to each other!)</p>
